# UFO SWARM
A web game using Phaser 2.  
This game was made as my final project at high school.  

You can play it online [here](https://patrickmargot.github.io/ufo-swarm/).  

Since it was one of my first big coding project, the code is really messy.  
I might rework and upgrade it to a Phaser 3 game.
